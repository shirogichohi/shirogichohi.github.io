We are covering sections of the book weekly, dedicating atleast two hours weekly as well as having hangout call weekly reviews . Main Goal The goal of R4DS community is to help you learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do Data Science 1.1 Getting Started You will need four things to be able to run the code in the R4DS Book: R, RStudio, An R Package called TIDYVERSE and A few other packages # Step one: Install R and Rstudio #Installing R: https://cloud.r-project.org #Installing Rstudio: http://www.rstudio.com/download #Step two: Download and install packages to be used. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) #Main package to be used install.packages(c(&quot;nycflights13&quot;, &quot;gapminder&quot;, &quot;Lahman&quot;)) #Others to be used What you will learn. Importing Data into R Tidying up your Data Transformation Visualization Models/programming Communicate What you will not learn The book does not cover every important topic, but everything it covers will get you up and running in no second. 1.2 Workflow The R4DS model of the tools is organised roughly according to the order in which you use them in an analysis. In refernec to the book, we’ll start with visualisation and transformation of data that’s already been imported and tidied. Within each chapter of the book, we try and stick to a similar pattern: start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned. We shall be solving these exercises together. Happy Learning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "]
